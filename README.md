# movielistr-backend-java
A real backend for the MovieListr application. It's a simple REST API that offers some CRUD operations on a list of movies. I wrote this for my front-end experiments. Feel free to use it however you want.

To run this backend, just clone the repository and in the root folder execute the command `gradle run`.
